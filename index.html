          <h2>A Banker to the Poorest of the Poor</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Professor Muhammad Yunus</b> was born on June 28, 1940. He is the
            founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, which pioneered
            microcredit. This is a method of banking where small loans are given
            to the poor, mostly to women, without collateral, for
            income-generating activities, to help them get out of poverty.The
            third of nine children, Prof Yunus was born in the village of
            Bathua, Chittagong. His father was Haji Muhammad Dula Mia Shawdagar,
            a jeweller, and his mother was Sofia. <br />

            In 1944, his family moved to the city of Chittagong, and he studied
            at Lamabazar Primary School. Later, he passed the matriculation
            examination from Chittagong Collegiate School. During his school
            years, he was an active Boy Scout, and travelled to West Pakistan
            and India in 1952, to Europe, the USA, and Canada in 1955 and to the
            Philippines and Japan in 1959, to attend Jamborees. In 1957, he
            enrolled in the Department of Economics at Dhaka University and
            completed his BA in 1960 and MA in 1961. <br />

            Following his graduation, Prof Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics,
            Dhaka University. Later he was appointed as a lecturer in economics
            in Chittagong College in 1961. In 1965, he was offered a Fulbright
            scholarship to study in the United States. He obtained his PhD in
            economics from Vanderbilt University in the US in 1969. From 1969 to
            1972, he was an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee
            State University in Murfreesboro, TN. <br />

            During the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, Prof Yunus founded
            a Citizen's Committee in Nashville, TN, published a newsletter named
            Bangladesh Newsletter, and ran the Bangladesh Information Center in
            Washington DC with other Bangladeshis living in the US, to raise
            support for the liberation of East Pakistan and lobby at the US
            Congress to stop military aid to Pakistan. <br />

            Inspired by the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Prof Yunus returned to
            that country in 1972, and joined the Economics Department of
            University of Chittagong after a brief spell in the Planning
            Commission. He became actively involved with poverty reduction after
            observing the famine of 1974, and established the Rural Economics
            Programme as part of the department's academic programme. In 1975,
            he organised Nabajug (New Era) Tebhaga Khamar (three share farm),
            which the government later adopted as the Packaged Input Programme.
            In 1976, during visits to very poor households in the village of
            Jobra near Chittagong University, Prof Yunus discovered that very
            small loans could make an enormous difference to a poor person's
            life. Jobra women who made bamboo furniture had to take out loans at
            usurious rates for buying bamboo, and had to give up their profits
            to the moneylenders. Shocked by this reality, he lent $27.00 from
            his own pocket to 42 people in the village to help them pay back
            their loans to the loan sharks and be free. When he approached
            traditional banks to lend to the poor, he found that they were not
            interested as the poor were not considered creditworthy. Prof Yunus
            strongly believed that, given the chance, the poor would repay the
            borrowed money, and that it would help them work their way out of
            poverty. After many efforts, he finally succeeded in securing a
            credit line from Janata Bank, offering himself as the guarantor, for
            his project to lend to the poor in Jobra in December 1976. On
            October 2, 1983, the project was converted into a fully fledged bank
            named Grameen Bank (Village Bank), specialising in making small
            loans to the poor. <br />

            As of May 2008, Grameen Bank (GB) has 7.5-million borrowers, 97% of
            whom are women. With 2 515 branches, GB provides services in 82 072
            villages, covering more than 97% of the villages in Bangladesh. It
            has lent over $7-billion to poor people since its inception and the
            repayment rate has been near 100%. All its money comes from the
            depositors of the bank. Prof Yunus has also founded a number of
            companies in Bangladesh to address diverse issues of poverty and
            development. These include Grameen Phone (a mobile telephone
            company), Grameen Shakti (an energy company), Grameen Fund (a social
            venture capital company), Grameen Textile, Grameen Knitwear, Grameen
            Education, Grameen Agriculture, Grameen Fisheries and Livestock,
            Grameen Business Promotion, Grameen Danone Foods Ltd, and Grameen
            Healthcare Services. He is also the founder of Grameen Trust, which
            extends the Grameen microcredit system all over the world. In
            October 2006, Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,
            along with Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and
            social development.
